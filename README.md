# MatrixProject
In the realm where nostalgia meets innovation, I embarked on a journey to resurrect the classic Snake game on an Arduino canvas. Inspired by the iconic Nokia mobile game, I sought to infuse the timeless gameplay with a touch of personal creativity.

The decision to build on an Arduino platform was driven by a passion for both gaming and hardware tinkering. With an 8x8 LED Matrix display, I meticulously coded the serpent's journey, drawing influence from classic arcade games that shaped my gaming history.

The hum of electronic components and the glow of LEDs transformed mere code into a tangible experience. This Snake incarnation is not just a recreation; it's a symphony of pixels, a fusion of nostalgia and innovation. Join me in this pixelated pursuit, as we guide the serpent through the electronic tapestry of Serpentine Symphony.

## Game description
Snake is a classic arcade game that originated in the late 1970s and gained widespread popularity on early mobile phones in the 1990s. The game is known for its simplicity yet addictive gameplay.

### Objective:
The player controls a snake, represented by a series of connected segments, on a two-dimensional grid or screen. The goal is to guide the snake to eat food (usually depicted as a dot or pixel) that appears randomly on the grid. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making the game progressively challenging.

## How to play
### Objective:
Your goal is to control the snake using the joystick, guiding it to consume the pixelated food that randomly appears on the 8x8 LED Matrix display.
As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, and your score increases. The higher your score, the faster the snake will move, adding a dynamic challenge.

### Controls:
Utilize the joystick to navigate the snake in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction, responding to your joystick inputs.

### Gameplay:
The LED Matrix has no boundaries â€“ if the snake reaches one end, it seamlessly continues from the opposite end.
The snake begins with three lives. Each time it collides with itself, you lose a life.
If the snake loses a life, it seamlessly continues from the opposite end with the same length. Your score and speed persist without resetting.

### Scoring:
The score increases with each food item consumed by the snake.
The snake's speed is directly proportional to your score. As your score rises, the snake will move faster, intensifying the gameplay.

### Lives:
You start the game with three lives.
Each collision with the snake's own body results in the loss of a life.
The game ends when all three lives are lost.
